    <h2>Step-by-Step Guide</h2>

    <!-- Step 11: Step 1 - Choose Components -->
    <h3>Step 1: Choose Components</h3>
    <p>Embark on your PC-building journey by meticulously researching and selecting the ideal components. Consider your budget, gaming requirements, and future-proofing strategies. Explore the latest processors, graphics cards, motherboards, memory modules, storage solutions, power supplies, and stylish cases to build a gaming powerhouse tailored to your preferences.</p>

    <!-- Step 12: Step 2 - Prepare Workspace -->
    <h3>Step 2: Prepare Workspace</h3>
    <p>Transform your workspace into a haven for precision and focus. Clear a spacious, well-lit area that allows you to move freely. Equip yourself with essential tools, including screwdrivers, cable ties, and an anti-static wrist strap. This well-prepared environment will enhance the efficiency and satisfaction of your PC-building experience.</p>

    <!-- Step 13: Step 3 - Install CPU -->
    <h3>Step 3: Install CPU</h3>
    <p>Delve into the heart of your gaming rig by carefully installing the central processing unit (CPU). Open the CPU socket on the motherboard, handle the CPU with utmost care, and delicately insert it into its designated slot. Secure the CPU in place, ensuring a solid foundation for the processing power that will drive your gaming adventures.</p>

    <!-- Step 14: Step 4 - Install GPU -->
    <h3>Step 4: Install GPU</h3>
    <p>Elevate your visual experience by installing the graphics processing unit (GPU). Identify the appropriate PCIe slot on the motherboard and delicately seat the graphics card. Secure it in place, unleashing the raw graphical prowess that will bring your games to life with stunning visuals and seamless performance.</p>

    <!-- Step 15: Step 5 - Install RAM -->
    <h3>Step 5: Install RAM</h3>
    <p>Elevate your system's multitasking capabilities by installing Random Access Memory (RAM). Open the RAM slots on the motherboard, carefully align the RAM sticks with the notches, and firmly press them into place. These memory modules will ensure swift and efficient data access, enhancing your gaming and overall computing experience.</p>

    <!-- Step 16: Step 6 - Connect Storage -->
    <h3>Step 6: Connect Storage</h3>
    <p>Establish a high-speed data pipeline by connecting your storage solutions. Whether it's a Solid State Drive (SSD) for rapid data access or a capacious Hard Disk Drive (HDD) for ample storage, use SATA cables to link them to the motherboard. Ensure proper power connections to create a reliable and responsive storage environment for your gaming library.</p>

    <!-- Step 17: Step 7 - Install PSU -->
    <h3>Step 7: Install PSU</h3>
    <p>Empower your gaming rig with a stable and reliable power supply. Mount the Power Supply Unit (PSU) in the case, strategically placing it for optimal airflow. Connect power cables to the motherboard, CPU, GPU, and storage devices. This robust power foundation will fuel your system, ensuring a consistent and efficient gaming performance.</p>

    <!-- Step 18: Step 8 - Cable Management -->
    <h3>Step 8: Cable Management</h3>
    <p>Elevate the aesthetics and airflow of your gaming masterpiece by mastering the art of cable management. Organize and secure cables with precision, creating a clean and visually appealing interior. Use cable ties strategically to bundle and route cables, enhancing both the cooling efficiency and the overall aesthetics of your gaming PC.</p>

    <!-- Step 19: Step 9 - Install Cooling System -->
    <h3>Step 9: Install Cooling System</h3>
    <p>Guard against overheating and optimize your system's thermal performance by installing a robust cooling solution. Follow the manufacturer's instructions to mount the CPU cooler with precision. This cooling prowess will maintain your PC's temperature within optimal limits, ensuring peak performance during intense gaming sessions.</p>

    <!-- Step 20: Step 10 - Power On and Test -->
    <h3>Step 10: Power On and Test</h3>
    <p>The moment of truth has arrived! Connect peripherals, power on your meticulously crafted PC, and bask in the glow of its power. Verify that all components are functioning correctly. Install the operating system and essential drivers to unleash the full potential of your gaming rig. Congratulations, you've successfully built a customized gaming PC ready to conquer the digital realms!</p>
